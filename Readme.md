## Inspiration for Equipo

- Due to unfortunate situation of Covid-19, workspace and atmosphere to an online workspace and uncharted region
- During the competition of **SSDC** (Space Settlement Design Competition), we had to organise ourselves and divide work between 50-60 people and there was a lot of confusion what every person was responsible even after assigning department heads
- With this project we are trying to counter this problem and find a better way for project manager/teacher/employer to keep a organise and keep a check on his colleagues

## How we built It

We used the famous python module **Django** to build the backend of the website and we used **Django-allauth** for authentication. We used **Html** ,**CSS** and **JavaScript** to build the website and make it look attractive, responsive and interactive

<p>We divided the work as frontend and backend between our member and made one member to compile the project and finalise the work</p>

## Challenges We ran Into

- There were obviously CSS Bugs like any other project. Also we faced problem using django like every projectt

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are happy that we were able to make a really **interactive and attractive website** which contains various features that help will help everyone
- We hope to ease the life of managers and attain full productivity of their team
